## Extensioninstaller for Code-OSS

This script is a really small helper written in bash because I often reinstall my operating system.
Because i'm too lazy to reinstall all my extensions over and over again i wrote a script which does
that automatically for me by installing all extensions (*.vsix*) found in './extensions' (*this one should created before use*) folder.
